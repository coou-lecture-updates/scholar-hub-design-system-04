# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the COOU School Updates system.

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. User Roles Table Security (RLS Protection)
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `supabase/migrations/20240801000001_secure_user_roles.sql`
- **Protection**: Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with restrictive policies
- **Policies**:
  - Users can only view their own roles
  - Only admins can INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE roles
  - All operations logged for audit purposes

### 2. Secure Admin Setup Process
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/setup-admin-secure/`
- **Security Measures**:
  - Admin credentials sourced from environment variables
  - No hardcoded credentials in source code
  - Audit logging for admin creation events
  - Service role authentication required

### 3. Real Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA)
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/verify-totp/`
- **Features**:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) verification
  - Secure secret storage with encryption
  - Failed attempt logging
  - Backup codes support
  - Rate limiting protection

### 4. Security Audit System
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Security event monitoring
  - Admin access tracking
  - Real-time security alerts
  - Audit log retention policies

## Required Environment Variables

### Supabase Secrets Configuration
Add these secrets in your Supabase dashboard:

```
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@email.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### Security Headers
The following security headers should be configured:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Database Security

### RLS Policies Applied
1. **user_roles table**: Strict access control
2. **audit_logs table**: Admin-only access
3. **user_totp_secrets table**: User-only access to own secrets

### Encryption
- TOTP secrets stored with encryption
- Sensitive data protected at rest
- TLS encryption for data in transit

## Authentication Security

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- Regular password rotation recommended

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- TOTP-based 2FA required for admin access
- Backup codes available for account recovery
- Failed attempt monitoring and blocking

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Events Tracked
- Failed login attempts
- Role changes
- Admin access
- Permission escalations
- Suspicious activity patterns

### Audit Log Retention
- Security events: 1 year
- Admin actions: Indefinite
- User activity: 90 days

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
1. Immediate access revocation
2. Audit log analysis
3. Security patch deployment
4. User notification if required
5. Post-incident review

### Contact Information
- Security Team: security@coou.edu.ng
- Admin Contact: admin@coou.edu.ng

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monthly security audit reviews
- [ ] Quarterly password rotation
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Continuous dependency updates
- [ ] Regular backup testing

### Security Checklist
- [ ] RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] Admin credentials secured
- [ ] 2FA configured and working
- [ ] Audit logging operational
- [ ] Security monitoring active
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data encryption standards
- Privacy policy enforcement
- User consent management

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Automated deprovisioning
- Role-based permissions

## Emergency Procedures

### Account Lockout
If admin account is compromised:
1. Contact Supabase support immediately
2. Disable affected user accounts
3. Reset all admin credentials
4. Review audit logs for unauthorized access
5. Implement additional security measures

### Data Breach Response
1. Identify scope of breach
2. Contain the incident
3. Assess impact and notify authorities
4. Communicate with affected users

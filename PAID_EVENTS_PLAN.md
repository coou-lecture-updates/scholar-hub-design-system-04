# Paid Events Management Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing paid events creation and management for moderators/admins, and how users will fund their wallets specifically for event participation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Wallet UI Relocation**: Moved all wallet components from user dashboard to events page only
2. **Enhanced Event Creation**: Added wallet integration for event creation fees
3. **Basic Event Management**: Admin/moderator event creation system exists

## üîß Current Issues Identified

### 1. Event Management - Missing Paid Events UI
**Problem**: The admin event management page (`/admin/events`) doesn't have clear UI to create PAID events with ticket pricing.

**Current State**: 
- Basic event creation form exists
- No clear distinction between free events and paid events
- No ticket pricing interface in the main event management

**Required Fix**:
- Add ticket pricing fields to the main event creation form
- Add "Requires Tickets" toggle
- Add price field with proper validation
- Show wallet balance and creation fee warning for paid events

### 2. Event Creation Flow Issues
**Problem**: The EnhancedEventCreation component has wallet integration but it's not used in the main admin interface.

**Current State**:
- EnhancedEventCreation has 4-step wizard with ticket pricing
- Main EventManagement uses basic form
- Inconsistent interfaces for creating events

**Required Fix**:
- Integrate EnhancedEventCreation into admin event management
- Or enhance the basic form with ticket pricing capabilities
- Ensure consistent user experience

### 3. Moderator Access & Permissions
**Problem**: Need clear definition of who can create paid events and access requirements.

- Define which roles can create paid events (admin + moderator?)
- Implement wallet balance checks for moderators
- Add proper error handling for insufficient funds

```

### Wallet Integration Points

3. **Event Purchase**: ‚úÖ Wallet-based ticket purchases

### Database Schema Status
- ‚úÖ Events table with pricing fields
- ‚úÖ Wallet and wallet_transactions tables
- ‚úÖ Event creation fee triggers
- ‚úÖ RLS policies for secure access

## üìä Success Metrics

- [ ] Wallet balance validation prevents events creation with insufficient funds
- [ ] Users can fund wallets only from events page
- [ ] Event creation fees are properly deducted and logged
- [ ] Clean separation of wallet functionality from dashboard

## üö® Critical Issues to Address
1. **Missing Paid Event UI in Admin**: Primary blocker for moderator event creation
2. **Inconsistent Event Creation Interfaces**: Two different forms exist
3. **Wallet Access Control**: Ensure wallet features only on events page
4. **Error Handling**: Better feedback for wallet-related operations
